In order to follow this guide, you will need to be comfortable working in your OS's shell, writing JavaScript, and working with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). A working knowledge of [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), and [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) would greatly ease the use of this library, but is not strictly necessary for getting started. The usage of a VCS such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is also encouraged, but is not explained here.
