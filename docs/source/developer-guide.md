### Developer Guide

In order to follow this guide, you will need to be comfortable working in your OS's shell, writing JavaScript, and working with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). A working knowledge of [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), and [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) would greatly ease the use of this library, but is not strictly necessary for getting started. The usage of a VCS such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is also encouraged, but is not explained here.

The Gnosis JavaScript library should work for any OS. It has the following system requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (versions >= 7 should work)
* NPM (should be installed with Node.js, and versions >= 5 should work)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)
